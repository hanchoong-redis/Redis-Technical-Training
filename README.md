# Technical Onboarding for Redis

A one‑stop, noise‑free technical grounding for Redis practitioners. This project equips Solutions Architects, Sales Engineers, DevRel, and Support with a practical, hands‑on understanding of Redis Open Source, Redis Stack, Redis Insight, and Redis Cloud—plus a repeatable workflow to produce high‑quality training artifacts from videos, PDFs, and docs.

## What’s inside

- 00_Redis Research: licensing/pricing, Stack overview, and common use cases.
- 01_Intro to Redis Open Source: notebooks covering core data structures and patterns.
- 02_Redis Insight: guided notebook on Redis GUI tooling and workflows.
- 03_Redis Stack: Search & Query, JSON, Time Series, and probabilistic structures.
- 04_Redis Cloud: architect‑oriented prompt to generate a comprehensive guide.
- PROMPT_*: reusable templates for articles, PDFs, research, and transcript conversion.
- Template.ipynb & experiments.ipynb: starter template and scratchpad.
- 00_Learning Points.md: running list of key takeaways.

## How to use

1. Follow the learning path: 01_Intro → 03_Redis Stack → 02_Redis Insight → 04_Redis Cloud.
2. Run notebooks locally against a Redis instance; validate concepts by executing code.
3. Use PROMPT_* templates to convert source material into consistent, cited training notebooks.
4. Capture insights in 00_Learning Points.md and contribute improvements back.

## Outcome

- Comprehensive baseline competency across Redis products and modules.
- Reproducible artifacts for demos, workshops, and internal enablement.
- A single, maintained place to find and extend Redis technical training materials.
