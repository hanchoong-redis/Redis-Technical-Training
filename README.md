# Technical Training for Redis, Working File 

ADHD-Friendly, Developer-Friendly, Noise-Free training materials for Redis Basic Technical Competency 

## Process

1. Youtube URL to [transcript extractor](https://www.youtubetotext.org/)
2. Apply prompt template to transcript. Provide video URL for attribution. 
3. Format in .ipynb 

## Prompt

Convert the provided transcript into **clean, readable Markdown**.

### Formatting Requirements:

* Output must be **developer-friendly and noise-free**.
* **Focus only on technical content.**
  * No filler, no personality, no commentary.
  * No suggestions, no anecdotes, no unverified facts.
  * Use explanations from the transcript to contextualize each command.
   * [ORIGINAL TEXT] In our example today, we'll be using Lists to represent a radio station's playlist. Each playlist is effectively a queue. We'll learn how to add and remove songs, how to view the next five songs, and how to see how many songs we have left to play. For our radio station, we'll keep a Redis List called playlist. Each element in our List will be the ID of a song. When adding new elements, we say that we're pushing them onto the List. We push elements onto the right-hand side of the List using the RPUSH command.
   * [IMPROVED TEXT] We’ll model a radio station playlist as a Redis List, treating it like a queue. Each element is a song ID. Songs are added to the right side with `RPUSH`, removed from the left with `LPOP`, and we can check upcoming songs or count how many remain with `LRANGE` and `LLEN`.

* **Do not omit details. Do not delete or compress content.**
* **Apply grammar/spelling corrections only if needed.**
* **All responses must be wrapped in a fenced block starting with ```markdown and ending with ```**.

### Structure:

1. **Title**:
   Use the format:
   `## [Video Title] - [Link to Video](YOUTUBE_LINK)`
2. **Section Headers**:
   Break content into logical sections with `###` headers for clarity.
   Do not use --- to separate sections. Section separation is done using Python code blocks.
3. **Code Blocks**:

   * Place Redis command examples inside fenced Python code blocks.
   * Format as:

     ```python
     # concise one-line explanation
     r.execute_command("COMMAND", "args...")
     print("verification output")
     ```
   * Always include a **verification command** when applicable.

    > **Implication**:  
    >
    > {{Description of the impact, outcome, or importance of the concept.}}  

### Enhancements:

* Use **official Redis documentation** to enrich each command explanation with precise references. Web search must be used to derive all citations and conceptual explanations.
* Search the web to include fleshed out concept explanations.
* Add citations inline for all web references using Markdown links.
* Citations and conceptual explanations must be included to expand on things not mentioned within the video itself.
* Keep explanations **complete and accurate**, never partial.

### Prohibited Styles:

* ❌ “Below is the transcript…” preambles.

--------------------------------

Hello. Thanks for tuning in to KRDS, Redis' number one hit station. Join me for a quick intro to Lists, one of the many Redis data types. In this video, I'll explain what Redis Lists are, how they work, and how they'll help us organize and deliver around-the-clock hits. You'll want to turn up the volume on this one.  All right, so think of a List as an ordered sequence of strings comparable to a Java ArrayList, a JavaScript array, or a Python list. Lists are great for storing strings, but you can also use them to implement stacks and queues. In our example today, we'll be using Lists to represent a radio station's playlist. Each playlist is effectively a queue. We'll learn how to add and remove songs, how to view the next five songs, and how to see how many songs we have left to play. For our radio station, we'll keep a Redis List called playlist. Each element in our List will be the ID of a song. When adding new elements, we say that we're pushing them onto the List. We push elements onto the right-hand side of the List using the RPUSH command. Phil Collins' classic hit, "Sussudio" -- that's under the song ID 25, so we'll start the number 25 in our queue. Our command will be RPUSH playlist 25. Sade's "Smooth Operator" -- that's 71. Our next command will be RPUSH playlist 71.  Now that we have some smooth grooves all queued up, it's just a matter of removing the first one we pushed into our playlist to know which song to play next. Since we're pushing all of our songs to the right-hand side, we'll remove, or pop, the songs from the left-hand side. The command to remove an element from our queue is LPOP. So we'll run LPOP playlist. Once we've popped the next song ID, we'll get the song from our database, and play it on air. Now that we've stored our songs in a queue, how do we find the next five songs scheduled to play? We'll use the LRANGE command. The LRANGE command returns elements within a List between a given start and end index offset. Here, we're asking for the first to the fifth elements. So our starting index is 0, and our ending index is 4. The complete LRANGE command is LRANGE playlist 0 4. Lastly, we'll want to ensure our playlist is adequately full of songs. Otherwise, we'll have -- [RECORD SCRATCH] [CRICKETS] -- radio silence.  To check the length of a Redis List, use the LLEN command. "LLEN playlist" returns the number of items in our queue, 7. OK, let's talk about the performance of the various List commands we've covered. LPOP, RPUSH, and LLEN are all O(1) constant time complexity operations. So performance isn't dependent on the length of the List. Constant time complexity is as efficient as it gets. LRANGE is O(s+n), where s is the distance of the start offset from the head, and n is the number of elements in the specified range. You need to be careful of LRANGE, especially when dealing with extra long Lists or when retrieving thousands or more elements. OK, let's review what we've covered in this segment. We've learned how to model a queue using a List and its RPUSH and LPOP commands. We learned how to get the first five elements from a List with LRANGE. We've also learned how to get the length of a List using LLEN.  What would you do with Redis Lists? A single List can hold over 4 billion entries. You don't have to rock this jam on repeat. And Lists aren't just for what you might normally think of as Lists. Need a queue? Just use RPUSH and LPOP. Need a stack? Use RPUSH and RPOP. Traverse a List? Remember, LRANGE. To learn more about Redis Lists, tune into our free online course, "Introduction to Redis Data Structures". It's part of Redis University, our online learning platform for all things Redis. Thanks for joining me in this Redis List listening session. Hope to see you again, and don't touch that dial.

### Example Output:

## Redis Lists Explained - [Link to Video](https://youtu.be/202yxNkUJyE)

A Redis List is an ordered sequence of strings, comparable to:

- Java `ArrayList`
- JavaScript `Array`
- Python `list`

Lists can be used to implement stacks and queues.  
In this example, a Redis List models a radio station's playlist queue.

### Example:
We’ll model a radio station playlist as a Redis List, treating it like a queue. Each element is a song ID. Songs are added to the right side with `RPUSH`, removed from the left with `LPOP`, and we can check upcoming songs or count how many remain with `LRANGE` and `LLEN`.

### Adding Songs with RPUSH

We add songs by pushing their IDs to the playlist. For example, Phil Collins’ Sussudio (Song ID: 25) and Sade’s Smooth Operator (Song ID: 71) are queued with:

```python
# push elements to the right-hand side of the playlist
r.execute_command("RPUSH", "playlist", 25)
r.execute_command("RPUSH", "playlist", 71)

# verify list length
print("Playlist length:", r.execute_command("LLEN", "playlist"))

> **Example**: `RPUSH playlist 25 71`

> **Result**:

> length of the List after push
