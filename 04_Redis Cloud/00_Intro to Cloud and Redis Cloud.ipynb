    "\n",
    "### Cloud Service Types\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Public Cloud**: Cloud resources owned and operated by third-party providers (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, Azure). Public cloud services provide shared infrastructure accessible over the internet. See AWS overview of hybrid/public connectivity models for standard terminology and patterns. [CITATION](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/hybrid-connectivity/hybrid-connectivity.html)\n",
    "- **Private Cloud**: Compute resources used by a single organization, hosted on-premises or by a third party. [CITATION](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/hybrid-connectivity/hybrid-connectivity.html)\n",
    "- **Hybrid Cloud**: Combination of private and public environments connected by secure networking (commonly IPsec VPN). [CITATION](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/hybrid-networking-lens/site-to-site-vpn.html)\n",
    "- **Multi-Cloud**: Use of two or more public clouds for different workloads or redundancy. [CITATION](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/hybrid-connectivity/hybrid-connectivity.html)\n",

    "> [Link: AWS Hybrid Connectivity Whitepaper](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/hybrid-connectivity/hybrid-connectivity.html)  \n",
    ">\n",
    "> **Concept**: `Hybrid connectivity` → Networking that links on-prem/private environments with public cloud VPCs.  \n",
    ">\n",
    "> **Context**: Used in hybrid deployments to extend private networks to cloud workloads.  \n",
    ">\n",
    "> **Example**: Site-to-Site VPN using IPsec tunnels with BGP for dynamic routing.  \n",
    ">\n",
    "> **Implication**:  \n",
