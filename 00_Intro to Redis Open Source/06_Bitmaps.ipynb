    "Treat a Redis String as a bitmap to mark explored tiles on a game map. Single-bit operations (`SETBIT`, `GETBIT`) are constant time; group operations like counting bits (`BITCOUNT`) are linear in the string length ([SETBIT](https://redis.io/docs/latest/commands/setbit/), [GETBIT](https://redis.io/docs/latest/commands/getbit/), [BITCOUNT](https://redis.io/docs/latest/commands/bitcount/)). Redis Strings are binary-safe sequences of bytes and support bit operations; maximum length is 512 MB, allowing up to 2³² addressable bits ([Strings](https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/data-types/strings/), [Bitmaps](https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/data-types/bitmaps/), [SETBIT docs note on 512 MB](https://redis.io/docs/latest/commands/setbit/)).\n",

    "[SPOOKY DUNGEON NOISES] Ah. Hello, traveler. I've been lost in this dungeon for nigh two weeks. I don't even know if I've been in this room before. If only there was a way I could efficiently store a large map in my meager pack. Ah, but there is! The Redis bitmap will show us the way. Follow me to learn more. [MUSIC PLAYING]  You might remember that Redis strings allow you to store binary data. What's really cool is that Redis provides a set of commands that allow you to treat these binary strings as bitmaps. This means that you can set and get any bit in the string, and you can do it with constant time complexity, which is as efficient as it gets. To demonstrate the power of Redis bitmaps, we'll be implementing an overworld mapping system to keep track of the path of a character in the online role-playing game, Mages & Minotaurs. When players start out on a new level, the map will be dark, as they wouldn't have traveled in any direction. As players explore, they'll be able to see their path on the map, and they'll also see what percentage of the map they've explored. We'll learn how to track the movement of a player across our game map. We'll also learn how to retrieve the player's path for future gaming sessions. Lastly, we'll learn how to check how many map tiles have been explored. Think of a Redis bitmap as an array of bits stored in a string. We'll associate each game map tile on its xy-coordinate plane with an offset in the bitmap. A 1 bit in an offset indicates the player has visited the corresponding tile. All other bits will default to 0, meaning unvisited. Our first map will be a 20 by 20 coordinate plane with the origin at 0,0 on the bottom left. We'll need a formula to compute the offset based on the desired XY-coordinate. Let's use this formula: Y multiplied by the width of the map plus X. With the coordinates 16, 12, we see that the offset will be 256. To set an individual bit, we'll use the SETBIT command. SETBIT takes three arguments: the key, which is the name of our bitmap, the bit offset, which is the bit offset from the beginning of the bitmap, and the value for that bit, which will be 1 or 0. Let's start our player around the center of the bottom of the dungeon map, coordinate 9,0. Since we're tracking a specific player's path for this particular map, we'll name the bitmap player:42:map:3, with 42 being the player's ID and 3 being the ID of the dungeon map. The full command will be SETBIT, our key, 9 1. This initial SETBIT command creates the bitmap and sets the ninth bit to 1. All bits from 0 through 8 are initialized to 0. Let's imagine our player moves up, or north. One tile north will place our player at the coordinate 9,1, which resolves the offset 29. The next command will be SETBIT, our key, 29 1. If we were to see a binary string representation of our bitmap, it wouldn't make a lot of sense. But if we stacked the string 20 characters wide on top of itself, we'll soon see a pattern. Watch this string evolve as we set more and more bits. Do you see a path? This is how we store all of the tiles our player has visited in a bitmap. To get values from our bitmap, we use the GETBIT command, providing the key and the offset. Let's check a couple of map locations to see how this works. If we run the command GETBIT, our key, 71-- 1 will be returned. This means our player has visited the tile before. We run the command GETBIT, our key, 342-- 0 will be returned. This means our player has not yet visited this tile.  To show the percentage of explored map tiles to the user, we'll use the BITCOUNT command. The command BITCOUNT and our key returns the number of 1 bits in the player's dungeon bitmap. If we divide that number by the total number of tiles in our map, we'll get the percentage of tiles that that player has visited. OK, let's review. We just learned how to represent our game player's path in an extremely space-efficient manner. We learned how to create a Redis bitmap and store a bit at an offset with SETBIT. We retrieved data stored at an offset with the GETBIT command. Finally, we used BITCOUNT to determine how much of the map a player has explored. What else can we do with bit-level operations in Redis? In this video, we've only just scratched the surface. We limited ourselves to getting and setting individual bits, but Redis actually supports variable-length bit fields using all of the standard bitwise operations-- think AND, OR, XOR, and so on. We'll look at this in another video, but if you're itching for more now, check out the BITFIELD command.

[SPOOKY DUNGEON NOISES] Thank you for navigating the twists and turns of the Redis bitmaps with me. I bid you farewell, traveler, and hope to bump into you again. And always, keep your map at the ready.  Yeah. [MUSIC PLAYING]"
