    "\n",
    "Redis Open Source (“Redis OSS”) is the freely available core database that provides single‑node and clustered in‑memory data structures with optional persistence, ACLs/TLS security, and community support. It scales via Redis Cluster (16,384 hash slots, client‑side routing with `MOVED/ASK` redirections) and achieves HA through replication and (optionally) Sentinel for non‑clustered deployments. Replication is asynchronous by default and durability relies on RDB/AOF.
